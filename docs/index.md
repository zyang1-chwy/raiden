Raiden is an end-to-end data collection toolkit for YAM robot arms. It covers
the full pipeline from hardware setup to policy-ready datasets: camera
calibration, teleoperation, multi-camera recording, dataset conversion, and
visualization.

[Get started :material-arrow-right:](guide/index.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

Key features:

- **Flexible control** - leader-follower teleoperation or SpaceMouse end-effector
  control, in bimanual or single-arm configurations.
- **Manipulability-aware IK** - uses [PyRoki](https://github.com/chungmin99/pyroki)
  and [J-Parse](https://jparse-manip.github.io/) for smooth and singularity-aware control.
- **Multiple depth backends** - IR structured light (RealSense), ZED SDK stereo,
  TRI Stereo,
  and [Fast Foundation Stereo](https://github.com/NVlabs/Fast-FoundationStereo)
  for high-quality depth tailored to manipulation scenes.
- **Heterogeneous cameras** - mix ZED and Intel RealSense cameras freely in a
  single session, across scene and wrist roles.
- **Automated extrinsic calibration** - hand-eye calibration for wrist cameras
  and static extrinsic estimation for scene cameras via ChArUco boards.
- **Metadata console** - a terminal UI (`rd console`) for reviewing
  demonstrations, correcting success/failure labels, and managing tasks and
  teachers.
- **Policy-ready output** - converts recordings to a simple, flat file format
  with synchronized frames, per-frame extrinsics, and interpolated joint poses,
  ready to plug into policy training frameworks.
- **[LeRobot export](guide/lerobot.md)** - export raw recordings straight to a
  LeRobot v3.0 dataset (parquet + mp4), roughly 50x smaller than the intermediate
  frame layer and without writing it at all.
- **[Fin-ray gripper support](guide/hardware.md#fin-ray-gripper)** - 3D-printable
  compliant grippers that conform to object shapes for robust and gentle grasping.

## Supported configurations

**Arm setups**

| Setup | Follower arms | Leader arms | CAN interfaces | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bimanual | 2 | 2 (one per side) | `can_follower_l`, `can_follower_r`, `can_leader_l`, `can_leader_r` | **Recommended** |
| Single arm | 1 | 1 | `can_follower_l`, `can_leader_l` | |

Leader arms are only required for leader-follower control (`--control leader`).
With SpaceMouse control (`--control spacemouse`), only follower arms are needed.
In single-arm mode the active arm is always named **left** for consistency. The
global coordinate origin is always the left-arm base frame in both setups.

**Control modes**

| Mode | Flag | Bimanual | Single arm | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Leader-follower | `--control leader` (default) | 2 leader + 2 follower arms | 1 leader + 1 follower arm | **Recommended** |
| SpaceMouse | `--control spacemouse` | 2 SpaceMice + 2 follower arms | 1 SpaceMouse + 1 follower arm | |

**Camera configurations**

Raiden supports heterogeneous camera setups — ZED and RealSense cameras can
be mixed freely within the same session.

| Configuration | | |
|---|---|---|
| 2 × ZED Mini (wrists) + 1 × ZED 2i (scene) | Bimanual, best synchronization | **Recommended** |
| 1 × ZED Mini (left wrist) + 1 × ZED 2i (scene) | Single arm | |
| Intel RealSense D400 series (any role) | No GPU required; see [Hardware Setup](guide/hardware.md#camera-configuration) for caveats | |

**Depth estimation**

| Method | Cameras | Description |
|---|---|---|
| IR structured light | Intel RealSense D400 series | On-device active IR depth |
| ZED SDK stereo | ZED cameras | NEURAL_LIGHT stereo depth from the ZED SDK (requires GPU) |
| [TRI Stereo](https://sites.google.com/view/stereoformobilemanipulation) | ZED cameras | TRI's learned stereo depth model tailored for robot manipulation scenes; `c32` and `c64` variants with ONNX and TensorRT backends (optional, requires CUDA GPU) |
| [Fast Foundation Stereo](https://github.com/NVlabs/Fast-FoundationStereo) | ZED cameras | Foundation model stereo depth; higher quality at object boundaries and thin structures (optional, requires CUDA GPU) |

## Roadmap

The following features are coming soon:

- **Policy training and inference** — built-in integration for policy training pipelines and closed-loop inference.
- **Initial scene condition management** — set up and save named initial scene conditions in the console to enable reproducible, side-by-side comparison of multiple policies under identical starting states.

## Acknowledgments

- **[PyRoki](https://github.com/chungmin99/pyroki)** - Raiden uses PyRoki for
  flexible inverse kinematics, incorporating constraints such as manipulability,
  which gives smoother and better-conditioned motion near singularities. Thanks
  to the PyRoki authors.

- **[J-Parse](https://jparse-manip.github.io/)** - enables manipulability-aware
  IK by efficiently computing task-space Jacobians for articulated robots.
  Thanks to the J-Parse authors for making this available.

- **[TRI Stereo Depth](https://sites.google.com/view/stereoformobilemanipulation)** - optional depth backend for ZED cameras. A learned stereo depth model developed at Toyota Research Institute, tailored for robot manipulation scenes.

- **[Fast Foundation Stereo](https://github.com/NVlabs/Fast-FoundationStereo)** - optional depth backend for ZED cameras. A foundation model for stereo depth estimation that produces higher-quality depth maps than the ZED SDK, particularly at object boundaries and on thin structures.
